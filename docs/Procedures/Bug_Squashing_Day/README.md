# Bug Squashing day

Every month, a Bug Squashing day is held. The day is when all Project Members
review remaining issues and squash bugs. The purpose of Bug Squashing day is,
tidying up issues, focusing on issues without being bothered by other regular
tasks.

The issues focused on that day, chosen by the participants, may not necessarily
be resolved on that day. The point is focusing on issues, resolving as many
issues as possible, and moving projects forward.

The table below describes actions to be taken in a Bug Squashing day.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reviewing issues              | List all issues unassigned to anyone, assign the issues to someone, or label it with `pending` |
| Fixing bugs                   | The participants decide one or more of issues to resolve by the end of that day and work on it |

The participants are expected to update the tickets, leaving comments about
progress, before the day so that everyone would shared the progress overview,
and the "reporting progress" would be short.

Next Bug Squashing day will be announced in the closing.
